%% For a step-by-step tutorial, see Training custom TensorFlow networks for JeVois.

This module supports RGB or grayscale inputs, byte or float32. 

You should create and train your network using fast GPUs, and then follow the instruction here to convert your trained network to TFLite format:
https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/

Then you just need to create a directory under JEVOIS:/share/tensorflow/ with the name of your network, and, in there, two files, labels.txt with the category labels, and model.tflite with your model converted to TensorFlow Lite (flatbuffer format). 

Finally, edit JEVOIS:/modules/JeVois/TensorFlowEasy/params.cfg to select your new network when the module is launched.
